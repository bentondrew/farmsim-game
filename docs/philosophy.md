This game allows for multiple players to play a relaxing, story based, simulation
together.

The game should be easy to pick up and put down (stopping or pausing with no
consequences). Along those lines, the game should make the content easily digestible;
in other words, the game should be easy to enter and pick up again if it is played in
short sessions or after long periods of time.

A player should be delighted with the game and enjoy playing it. The game should be
therapeutic. When a player is done playing, they should leave with hope and optimism.
