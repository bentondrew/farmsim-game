Centered around a community.

There are multiple professions in the community that a player can select to play. When a
player selects a profession, they take the place of the NPC who would fill that role.
Playing the different professions would add content as the player would get to
experience story lines of new characters that fill a role they played before.

*Proposal*
Players can switch professions mid game? If so, a current NPC player filling that role
would leave the community and a new one would join to fill the vacated role. The new
NPC would join with their story at the start.

Ideas for professions:
- Farmer
- Blacksmith
- Rancher
- Baker
- Alchemist/ medicines etc

The game has something like a resource gathering, crafting, production game loop.
